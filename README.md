Deploy a secure, highly available, and scalable website.


### High-availability

High-availability infrastructure is configured to deliver quality performance and handle different loads and failures with minimal or zero downtime.

### Scalable

The ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand.

### **Step 1: Create a Security Group.**

- Login into the AWS Console using the login credentials.
- Create a security group.
- Give an appropriate name, and description to that security group. Also, select the VPC.



- Add  SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS in the inbound rules.


- The security group is created successfully.


### Step 2: Launch Templates

- Launch three EC2 Templates.



- Create a launch template, and give a name to that template.


- Likewise, Create three templates
- Mobile, Laptop, and Home these are the three different templates for different web pages.


### Step 3: Create three Auto Scaling Group

- Search auto-scaling in the search box.


- Give a name to the auto-scaling group and choose the launch template.


- Check the Instance type requirements.


- Select the Availability zones



- Select No load balancer, as we havenâ€™t yet created a load balancer



- Configure group size and scaling
- Give the desired capacity(min.desired and max.desired)


- Choose instance maintenance policy.



- Create the same configuration of the auto-scaling group for home and mobile templates


### Step 4: Create target group

- Create three different target group.



- Specific group details, Choose the target type.



- Give a name for the target group.


- Give the health check path


- And create all three target groups.



### Step 5:Attach target group to the Auto-scaling group

- Go to the auto-scaling group and on a particular group.
- Scroll down and in the load balancer click on edit.
- Select the Application Load balancer
- Now, select the target group that you want to attach the auto-scaling group.
- Likewise, attach all three target groups to the auto-scaling group.


### Step 6 :Create a Load Balancer

- Select the load balancer from sidebar.



- Choose a load Balancer type(Application Load Balancer)



- In, Basic Configuration, give a name to the load balancer.



- Select the availability zones in the Network.



- Attach the Security group.
- Add the Listeners port as 443 for HTTPS.



### Step 7: Create an AWS Certificate Manager

- Search AWS Certificate Manager in the search bar in the console.



- Give your DNS Name, and request the certificate.



- Once the certificate is issued then, click on the Certificate ID.
- Create a record in route53.



- Select the Is domain in Route53, select the domain name, and Click on Create Record.



- In the Security policy, you need to give a certificate for HTTPS. Select your certificate.



- The load balancer is successfully created.



- Click on the ALB name and scroll to manage the rules.
- Check the Check box next to the port.



- Add rule for Laptop then click next.



- In the add condition, Select the path in the dropdown, and give the path that you want, and click on Confirm.



- Now in action give the target group.



- Set the priority for the rule.



- Review and create the rule.



- Likewise, Create rule for mobile also.



- In Route 53, Create one hosted zone.
- Click on the hosted zone, you will get the value that you  will have to add in the Hostinger(From where you have purchased the DNS)
- The record will be created



When you hit the DNS the website is successfully displayed.



- The connection for the Website is secure.



### Summary

You have successfully set up a scalable and load-balanced infrastructure that secures your connection with HTTPS and SSL. This will ensure that your application can handle increased traffic and provide a secure connection for users.
